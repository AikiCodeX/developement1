And then you can do that afterwards. Yeah, we can upload it right back that way. Okay, cool. So let's see. We're talking blah blah blahAfter 10 seconds, it should send the audio to the API and then it gets saved.for another 10 seconds and it should send the audio to the API again. And so this is happening, happening every 10.Just all the pens. Do I have to be in the browser? Can you tell me? I want to minimize this browser.So maybe we have to be in the browser.So the only time it works is 30 seconds. Yeah, we can do 30 seconds. We can do a minute. I think I had.Apples, apples, apples.Silence. Silence.But you know what, I don't think it hears you unless you have the browser open. Bananas. The browser has to be open.and then it'll save it to the files. I'm guessing like the microphone doesn't listen to you after you close the browser.Yeah. Silence. That's good.That was the bounce I had between...the time it takes to be processed, and the shortest amount of audio that I could send.If I like a 10 minute audio file, it could only take, it might only take a minute to process. Okay, great. But if I send a 30 second audio.It might take 25 seconds to process. Weird. Yeah. So it's not proportional by any means.So there's a long amount of work, but I figured if it's a 45-minute conversation that they have with the patient.If I send a whole 45 minute audio file, because I was just going to say a 45 minute audio file and send it, but it would take.five minutes to transcribe. So my solution behind it was every 30 seconds, I'm going to save the audio file, send it, it's going to take 10 seconds or 25 seconds.to send back, and then I can send the next one, and it's going to take however amount of time to send back, and then I can send the next one, and so on and so forth. So at the end...at 44 minutes you send the last one and it only takes 20 seconds to get back because you're only transcribing 30 seconds so instead of having to wait minutes for the whole thing to transcribeIt only takes 20 seconds.But we can start it again and let it transcribe and see how long it actually takes. See how it already added words?Right here and then it's going to send it.you
