Like I'm evaluating you? How's it going? Pretty good, how about you? I'm well, thank you for asking. So last time I sent you an increase of medication, right? Uh-huh. And how did it go? It went good. I think my depression went down, but my anxiety went up a little bit, I noticed. Okay, so less depressed but more anxious and you're taking the medication every day? Yeah, every day. And how's your sleep? I'd say probably most nights I get eight hours. Okay, your energy, is it low, normal, or high? It's super low. Your appetite, low, normal, or high? Low too. Your motivation, low, normal, or high? Medium. Okay, any thoughts of suicide? No. Homicide? No. Hearing voices, seeing shadows? No. Okay.you want to do today? You want to increase the B-trend again or you want me to leave it the same? I'd say leave it the same. Is there anything you can do for my anxiety? Yeah. I can give you Boost-Borone twice a day, 5 milligrams. Let's see how that helps. Okay. Is there any side effects I should know about? Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, and sleepiness. But they'll go away after 5 days. If it lasts longer than 5 days, then call the clinic and meet the girls and I'll call you. Okay. Yeah. Let's do that then. Alright. Same pharmacy? Yeah. Alright. I'll send it over. We'll see you in 6 weeks. Alright. See you then. Bye.
